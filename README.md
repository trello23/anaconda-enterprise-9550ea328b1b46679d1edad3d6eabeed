anaconda-project run
```

Then visit [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006)

## Sample Data

To regenerate the trained files run `python mnist.py`.

This takes a while, so a snapshot of the trained files are available at: https://storage.googleapis.com/anaconda-public-data/projects-data/tensorboard/mnist_tutorial.zip
This snapshot is downloaded and used when the project is run.
